                            <p class="faq-answer">
                                Most directories start accepting Black Friday deals in late October/early November. We recommend submitting 2-3 weeks before Black Friday for maximum visibility and early bird traffic.

                            <p class="faq-answer">
                                While we can't guarantee approval (each directory has its own criteria), we optimize every submission to maximize acceptance rates. We'll notify you of any rejections and the reasons provided.
